# Physarum

GPU implementation of Physarum-based models of transport networks presented by Jones (2010) and Elek et al. (2021)

This implementation aims to provide an interactive window for experimentation as well as functionality for rendering simulations to files.

It is written in C++ and uses OpenCL to execute kernels on the system's GPU. It should compile and execute on any system with the OpenCL SDK installed.
